# DavinC-Arch

DavinC is a decentralized application ecosystem initiative, designed to revolutionize communication and data management by putting users in control of their data. With a focus on privacy, security, and decentralization, DavinC integrates cutting-edge peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies like **libp2p** and **WebRTC**, eliminating the need for centralized servers.

## Features

- **Decentralized Communication**: Leveraging libp2p and WebRTC, we enable direct, secure, and private communication between users.
- **Privacy-Centric**: Your data remains fully under your control, with no reliance on third-party servers.
- **P2P Infrastructure**: Our platform operates on a peer-to-peer model, ensuring robustness and censorship resistance.
- **Open Source**: Contributions are welcome to improve our ecosystem and enhance user control over personal data.

## Technologies

- **WebRTC**: Real-time communication framework for secure data exchange.
- **Python**: Backend logic using Flask (or similar framework).
- **Vite-React**: Frontend built with Vite for fast and optimized performance.
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure communication via encryption.
- **libp2p**: Networking stack for building peer-to-peer applications (under development).
